			  Hello, I'm Konsta Korhonen, a student at Aalto University School of Engineering. I'm in the final stretch of my Master's Degree studies, with a focus on production and materials 
			  engineering and minor studies in computer science including machine learning and data mining. I'm very interested in combining software with visual and user-centered design and enjoy 
			  testing my skills with game development projects. I've collected some of my most recent projects on this page, feel free to take a look and contact me at konsta.k.korhonen@aalto.fi

			  The goal of the project was to design and manufacture a simple machine with a limited budget. The frame was laser cut and the drive was machined with EDM. 3D-printing was utilized to 
			  accurately fit the drive in the frame. My responsibilities in the project group were preliminary design, material selection and design and assembly of the ramp part of the frame. The assembled dispenser functioned well, 
			  despite the thickness limitations of the laser cutter that caused accuracy issues as the parts had to be cut twice.

			  As a part of an Advanced Manufacturing course, the objective was to model and 3D print an object with moving parts, conformal cooling, lattice structure and topological optimization.
			  I decided to do my take on the gear bearing, inspired by the design of Emmett Lalish at Thingiverse. My version has straight gears with slopes at the end instead of herringbone gears. Additionally, a conformal
			  cooling pipe was added and the casing was topologically optimized using Creo Simulate FEM analysis and CAESS ProTOpCI. After a while of manual post-processing, the finished print started spinning smoothly,

              <p class="card-text">
			  The goal of the project was to study a simple mechanism or machine by creating a free-body diagram and carrying out multi-body simulations (MBS), strength analysis using finite element method (FEM) 
			  and modeling the mechanism assembly. Mathcad was used to solve the free-body diagram calculations and to validate the MBS of a simplified wiper mechanism done in Creo. NX was used to create a detailed model 
			  of the wiper assembly and also to test different designs with FEM to see which types of geometries are the most optimal. Additional detailed design was done in the forms of a requirements list, bill of materials,
			  manufacturing and part purchasing plan and cost analysis.

			  The objective was to model and plan the machining for a swivel base for a bench clamp. The CAD model, drawings and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) simulation were done in Creo. A manufacturing
			  plan was formulated, which included specific machining steps, tolerances, tools, toolpaths, machining parameters, fixtures and time estimates. These were implemented in the 
			  CAM plan and simulation with the Manufacturing module of Creo.

              Industrial Gear Factory Simulation 
              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">
			  In this group project, we had the task of planning the implementation of a new industrial gear factory. This comprised of planning the factory layout and material flow, machine and other equipment investments,
			  production control principles and production simulation, which was my main responsibility together with the layout planning. 
			  </p>
			  <p class="card-text">
			  The simulations were carried out with Tecnomatix Plant Simulation and they included 
			  workers, shifts, estimated processing times, machine failures, repairs, transporting parts and assembly. Optimal worker amounts and storage sizes were determined by running repeated simulations with each parameter
			  combination to reduce variance in results using an experiment manager tool. The simulation results were used to determine bottleneck resources and carry out investment calculations.

              Flow Shop Scheduling
              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">
			  Flow shop scheduling is a more restricted sub class of the NP-hard job shop scheduling problem, mainly in that operations of jobs must be performed in a specified order. There exist simple prioritizing
			  rules such as firs in first out and earliest due date, but also more complex methods that optimize statistics such as throughput time, utilization rate, tardiness and makespan. 
			  </p>
			  <p class="card-text">
			  The purpose of the project was to analyze the results from different these methods, compare them and understand how they behave as the complexity of the system increases. The optimizations for a four-machine 
			  flow shop were done in IBM ILOG CPLEX and Excel was used to create charts of the results. Additionally, the effect of buffer size on throughput and throughput time was studied on production lines of different 
			  lenghts. This was achieved with Tecnomatix Plant Simulation by running repeated simulations with each parameter combination.

			  The task was to research how the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) works and then apply it to real-world data with Matlab. The 9-dimensional data set 
			  consisted of nutritional values of 961 food items, so the objective was to find dependencies between the food properties and then cluster the data and analyze the clusters by generating a U-matrix, 
			  component plane and PCA-projection visualizations. A total of six food categories were recognized.

               Graph-mining Network Statistics
              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">
			  Small networks can easily be visualized. A example of this is the component of a social network depicted above, which I created with Gephi. When the number of nodes rises from hundreds to thousands or
			  millions, and the number of edges rises even more, visualizing the network becomes harder. 
			  </p>
			  <p class="card-text">
			  The most efficient way to extract information from networks is utilizing graph-mining algorithms to compute
			  statistics, such as mean distance and diameter of the network. The goal of the project was to attempt to write algorithms that exactly compute the statistics of networks that increase in size and then resort 
			  to approximation schemes as the computation becomes prohibitively slow. It quickly became evident how much more efficient the approximation algorithms are and how surprisingly accurate the approximations were.

			  and can reach new areas as new movement options are unlocked. With skilful control, it's possible to reach areas without finding all the available movement enhancements. The game engine is Unity and scripting 
			  is done in C#. Credit for the character controller template goes to Erik Roystan Ross.
